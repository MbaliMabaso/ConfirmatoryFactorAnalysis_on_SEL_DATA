###Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) on SEL Data 
---

##Introduction
---

This report showcases the application of Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) data. This project evaluates the factor structure
of SEL-related constructs using Python (semopy) and assesses model adequacy through goodness-of-fit indices.

Two CFA models were tested:
Model 1: A five-factor SEL structure based on theoretical constructs.
Model 2: A refined four-factor model aimed at improving model fit.

This report presents a comparison of both models, interpretations of results, and recommendations for further improvement.
